# SNHU-CS-320

In order to ensure that my software is functional and suecure, I can do a few things. First I can write tests. This ensures that all of the requirements are met. It also helps to ensure no regressions are introduced in the future. I can make sure that my software is secure by regularly checking for security vulnerabilities in dependencies and mitigating those risks accordingly.

I interpret users needs and incorporate them into software by trying to convert each requirement into a test. Some are easier than others but for the most part, it is fairly simple to translate someones requirements from English to code.

I approach designing software very slowly. I start my making sure that my database design is appropriate. Getting this step wrong will affect other aspects of the project down the line. I also like to use Test Driven Development which involves writing tests before any other code is written.
